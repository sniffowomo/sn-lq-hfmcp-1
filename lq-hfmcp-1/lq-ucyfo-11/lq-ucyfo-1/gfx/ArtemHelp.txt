Convert images from multiple formats (jpg, png, webp, etc…) to ASCII art

Usage: artem [OPTIONS] [INPUT]...

Arguments:
  [INPUT]...
          Paths or URLs to the target image. If the input is an URL, the image is downloaded and then converted. The original image is NOT altered.

Options:
  -c, --characters <characters>
          Change the characters that are used to display the image.The first character should have the highest 'darkness' and the last should have the least (recommended to be a space ' '). A lower detail map is recommend for smaller images. Included characters can be used with the argument 0 | 1 | 2. If no characters are passed in, the default set will be used.

  -s, --size <size>
          Change the size of the output image. The minimum size is 20. Lower values will be ignored and changed to 20. This argument is conflicting with --width and --height.
          
          [default: 80]

      --height
          Use the terminal maximum terminal height to display the image. This argument is conflicting with --size and --width.

  -w, --width
          Use the terminal maximum terminal width to display the image. This argument is conflicting with --size and --height.

      --ratio <scale>
          Change the ratio between height and width, since ASCII characters are a bit higher than long. The value has to be between 0.1 and 1.0. It is not recommend to change this setting.
          
          [default: 0.42]

      --flipX
          Flip the image along the X-Axis/horizontally.

      --flipY
          Flip the image along the Y-Axis/vertically.

      --centerX
          Center the image along the X-Axis/horizontally in the terminal.

      --centerY
          Center the image along the Y-Axis/vertically in the terminal.

  -o, --output <output-file>
          Output file for non-colored ascii. If the output file is a plaintext file, no color will be used. The use color, either use a file with an .ansi extension, or an .svg/.html file, to convert the output to the respective format. .ansi files will consider environment variables when creating colored output, for example when COLORTERM is not set to truecolor,the resulting file will fallback to 8-bit colors.

      --invert
          Inverts the characters used for the image, so light characters will as dark ones. Can be useful if the image has a dark background.

      --background
          Sets the background of the ascii as the color. This will be ignored if the terminal does not support truecolor. This argument is mutually exclusive with the no-color argument.

      --border
          Adds a decorative border surrounding the ascii image. This will make the image overall a bit smaller, since it respects the user given size.

      --no-color
          Do not use color when printing the image to the terminal.

      --outline
          Only create an outline of the image. This uses filters, so it will take more resources/time to complete, especially on larger images. It might not produce the desired output, it is advised to use this only on images with a clear distinction between foreground and background.

      --hysteresis
          When creating the outline use the hysteresis method, which will remove imperfection, but might not be as good looking in ascii form.This will require the --outline argument to be present as well.

      --verbose <verbosity>
          Choose the verbosity of the logging level. Warnings and errors will always be shown by default. To completely disable them, use the off argument.
          
          [default: warn]

          Possible values:
          - off:   Do not show logs
          - error: Only show errors
          - warn:  Show errors and warnings
          - info:  Show info logs
          - debug: Show debug logs
          - trace: Show trace logs

  -h, --help
          Print help (see a summary with '-h')

  -V, --version
          Print version
